        <h3>Hi! I'm Chris.</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer based in Brooklyn. You can check out
          some of the languages and frameworks I'm comfortable with above, but I
          will say I have a particular fondness for <em>React</em> and{" "}
          <em>SQL</em>. Crazy, right?{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to Software Engineering, I worked in the Wine Industry, with
          experience in everything from production, to retail sales, to
          hospitality and restaurants. Wine is still a huge part of my life, so{" "}
          let's talk about it!
        </p>
        <p>Some fun facts about me: in addition to English, I'm fluent in Mandarin Chinese and French, I'm a huge sports fan (Go Chelsea / trailblazers / Patriots / Lewis Hamilton!), and I love listening to and discovering music both new and old.</p>
